\usage{
plot_layer_diff(
  net,
  L1,
  L2,
  layout = c("fr", "kk", "mds", "lgl", "graphopt"),
  directed = FALSE,
  edge_alpha = 0.7,

  dpi = 300
)
}
\arguments{
\item{net}{multinet object (usable with multinet::edges_ml()).}

\item{L1, L2}{Character layer ids to compare.}

\item{layout}{Name of igraph layout to use on the union ("fr","kk","mds","lgl","graphopt").}

\item{directed}{Logical; build directed graphs? Default FALSE.}

\item{edge_alpha}{Numeric in \link{0,1}; edge transparency.}

\item{vertex_cex}{Vertex point size.}

\item{results_dir}{Where to save when file is relative.}

\item{file}{Optional filename to save (PNG). If NULL, just draws to the current device.}

\item{width, height, dpi}{PNG device size (inches) and resolution when saving.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a list with igraphs and counts.
}
\description{
Shows edges present only in layer A (red), only in layer B (green),
and edges common to both (grey). Positions are computed on the union graph.
