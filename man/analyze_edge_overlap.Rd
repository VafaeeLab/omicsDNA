\title{Analyze Edge Overlap Across Network Layers}
\usage{
analyze_edge_overlap(net)
}
\arguments{
\item{net}{A multilayer network object of class \code{ml.network}, typically
created using create_multilayer_network().}
}
\value{
A symmetric matrix containing Jaccard similarity scores for edge overlap
between each pair of layers.
}
\description{
This function calculates the Jaccard similarity index for gene-gene relationships (edges)
between all pairs of layers in a multilayer network and visualizes the overlap as a heatmap.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item Computes Jaccard index for edges using \code{layer_comparison_ml()} with \code{method = "jaccard.edges"}.
\item Converts the matrix to long format and creates a heatmap.
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
edge_jaccard_matrix <- analyze_edge_overlap(net)
}
