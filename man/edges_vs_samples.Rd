\usage{
edges_vs_samples(
  communities,
  num_samples,
  net = NULL,
  edges = NULL,
  num_edges = NULL,
  layers = NULL,
  directed = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{communities}{Optional data.frame with a 'layer' column (used only as a
hint to restrict/reorder layers for compatibility with older code).}

\item{num_samples}{Named numeric vector of sample counts per layer (non-negative).}

\item{net}{Optional multilayer object that can be coerced to a list of igraphs
via as.list(net); edges are counted with igraph::ecount().}

\item{edges}{Optional data.frame of edges with endpoints and layer information.
Endpoints auto-detected among common pairs (from/to, source/target, etc.).
If from_layer/to_layer exist, only intra-layer rows are kept.}

\item{num_edges}{Optional named vector of precomputed edge counts per layer.
If supplied, it takes precedence over \code{net}/\code{edges}.}

\item{layers}{Optional character vector to restrict/reorder layers.}

\item{directed}{Logical; if FALSE (default), undirected duplicates are
canonicalised to min(u,v)–max(u,v) before counting.}
}
\value{
Named integer vector of edge counts per layer with attribute "plot".
}
\description{
For each network layer, compute the number of edges and draw a scatter plot
(y = edges, x = samples) with an OLS trend line. Returns a named integer vector
(one value per layer) and attaches the ggplot object under attr(x, "plot").
