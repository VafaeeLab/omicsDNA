\title{Analyze Actor (Gene) Overlap Across Network Layers}
\usage{
analyze_actor_overlap(net)
}
\arguments{
\item{net}{A multilayer network object of class \code{ml.network}, typically
created using create_multilayer_network().}
}
\value{
A symmetric matrix containing Jaccard similarity scores for actor
(gene) overlap between each pair of layers.
}
\description{
This function calculates the Jaccard similarity index for actors (genes)
between all pairs of layers in a multilayer network using the
\code{multinet} package. The results are visualized as a heatmap.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item Computes pairwise Jaccard indices of shared actors across layers.
\item Converts the similarity matrix to long format.
\item Plots the result as a heatmap using \code{ggplot2}.
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
actor_jaccard_matrix <- analyze_actor_overlap(net)
}
