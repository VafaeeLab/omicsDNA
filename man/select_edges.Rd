\title{Select Common Edges Within Each Group Based on Repetition Threshold}
\usage{
select_edges(edge_lists, threshold_ratio = 0.7)
}
\arguments{
\item{edge_lists}{A nested list of edge lists for each group (e.g., age group).
The structure should be: \code{list[[group]][[repetition]]}, where each element
is a data frame with columns \code{from}, \code{to}, and \code{weight}.}

\item{threshold_ratio}{A numeric value (between 0 and 1) indicating the minimum
proportion of repetitions in which an edge must appear to be retained.
Default is \code{0.7}, meaning an edge must appear in at least 70\% of repetitions.}
}
\value{
A named list (\code{selected_edges}) of data frames. Each data frame contains
the filtered and averaged edges for a specific group, with columns:
\code{from}, \code{to}, and \code{weight} (mean weight across selected repetitions).
}
\description{
Identifies and retains edges that appear consistently across multiple repetitions
within each group and computes their average weights.
}
\details{
This function is typically used after constructing multiple networks per group
(e.g., via bootstrapping or subsampling) and allows filtering for reproducible interactions.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
selected_edges <- select_edges(edge_lists, threshold_ratio = 0.7)
head(selected_edges[["Group1"]])
